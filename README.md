# In_Vehicle_EDR
EDR devices are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: Collision, Over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of this device. The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a car EDR device in a PIC based microcontroller supported by various peripherals.

# Requirements

Default Screen
◦ When the system is in Operation Mode, it would act like a dash board which would show the current time, speed of vehicle and the latest occurred event..

Login Screen

◦ On press of the UP or DOWN (User Keys) keys the system should prompt for password.
◦ The password would be the combination of 4 presses (User Keys).
◦ Each press should be denoted a "*" symbol.
◦ Every wrong entry would, re prompt for password (Max 3 times for every 15 minutes).
◦ Incomplete key press (pause of 3 seconds) would lead to Default Screen.
