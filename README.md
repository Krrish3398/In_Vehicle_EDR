# In_Vehicle_EDR
EDR devices are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: Collision, Over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of this device. The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a car EDR device in a PIC based microcontroller supported by various peripherals.
